# Slack Clone

This is a Slack clone, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) component library, [convex](https://www.convex.dev/) database and auth, following this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXITA5MZIiI) by [Code with Antonio](https://www.youtube.com/@codewithantonio).

The application is deployed on Vercel [here](https://slack-clone-green-omega.vercel.app/).

## Note

1. For the API hooks, [@tanstack/react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) is used to wrap the `useQuery` and `useMutation` hook from `@convex/react`.
2. For form, [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) is used.
